Description: PaleoFidelity assembles a series of custom functions designed to assess live-dead agreement
    (paleontological fidelity) between live assemblages (ecological community data) and sympatric death assemblages.
    The functions allow to assess fidelity in terms of rank and relative abundance agreement,
    alpha diversity and alpha evenness. Multi-level sample standardization is available.
    PaleoFidelity also includes customized plotting functions for data visualization.
