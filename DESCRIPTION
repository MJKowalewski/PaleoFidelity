Description: A set of tools designed for assessing live-dead agreement
        (paleontological fidelity) between live assemblages (ecological
        community data) and sympatric death assemblages. The functions 
        allow to assess fidelity in terms of rank and relative abundance 
        agreements, alpha diversity, and alpha evenness. Includes multi-level 
        sample standardization and plotting functions for data visualization.
