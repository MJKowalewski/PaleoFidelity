\title{FidelitySummary (to assess data compliance issues)}
\usage{
FidelitySummary(live, dead, gp = NULL, report = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{live}{A matrix with counts of live-collected specimens (rows=samples, columns=species/taxa)}

\item{dead}{A matrix with counts of dead specimens (rows=samples, columns=species/taxa)
(dimensions must match)}

\item{gp}{An optional factor, with two or more levels, defining sample groups.
The length of gp must equal number of rows in live and dead and at least two levels must
include 2 or more observations to allow for by-group analyses.}

\item{report}{Logical (default=F), set report=T to print additional warnings and data summary}
}
\value{
Returns errors and critical warnings.
    No objects returned unless report=T (return additional warnings and data summary)
}
\description{
FidelitySummary function checks if the input objects are compliant.
This function is used invisibly in other PaleoFidelity functions. However, users can use it directly to
obtain a full list of warnings and a basic summary of user-provided objects (report=T)
}
\examples{

data(FidData)
FidelitySummary(live=FidData$live, dead=FidData$dead, gp=FidData$habitat, report=T)
